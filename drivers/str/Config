# Driver specifications
#
# multiple major numbers for a driver may be allocated two ways:
# . by explicitly requesting n-majors (see below)
# . by requesting an n-minors value large enough to require more than
#   one major number.
#
# strconf now supports allocating multiple major numbers, but
# not all drivers do.  It is only known to work for 'fifo' at this time.

# Loadable specifications
#
# If you do not have a system with support for demand-loading modules
# into the kernel, you will have to load these modules by hand or in
# the startup scripts.
# If you do not use the loadable keyword at all, everything is linked
# into streams.o.

#loadable connld	too closely coupled with LiS to be loadable
#loadable sad	too closely coupled with LiS to be loadable

# Node specifications
#
# Loop driver now makes its own nodes in its init routine as an 
# example of how to use lis_mknod.
#
# Use of the optional major-idx field is for multiple-major drivers, to
# specify an index, 0 to nmajors-1.  It requires a driver name in the
# major field
