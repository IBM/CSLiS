* This driver's open routine divides the device number passed in into	*
* the major and minor parts.  It treats the minor number as the major	*
* number of the driver that the user really wants to open.  It then	*
* calls that driver's open routine passing in the target driver's	*
* major and minor zero.  It sets the clone option bit in this open.	*
*									*
* The queue passed to clone is given the attributes of the target	*
* driver rather than of the clone driver.				*
*									*
* When this driver returns from its open routine the dev_t structure	*
* passed to it will no doubt be modified.  The caller, perhaps clear	*
* back in the I/O system, must take care to notice this and allocate	*
* a new inode for this stream.						*
